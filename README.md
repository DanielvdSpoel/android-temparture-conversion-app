# Android temparture conversion application
The first android application I made for Widener CSCI-311

# Requirements:
- Design and build an Android app that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
- The app must allow the user to enter a Celsius temperature and then display the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit.
- The app must allow the user to enter a Fahrenheit temperature and then display the equivalent temperature in Celsius.
- Use TextView, EditText, and Button widgets in your app. Position the widgets using a ConstraintLayout.
- Design the app so that it has a clean, well-designed interface and is intuitive to use.
